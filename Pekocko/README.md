# HOT TAKES

The company So Pekocko tasked me with the creation of an api to connect their existing frontend to an existing backend.

### Technologies Used

Node.js
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose

## Installation

Clone this repo, run `npm install`.

## Usage

Run `npm start`. This should both run the local server and launch your browser.

If your browser fails to launch, or shows a 404 error, navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080.

Use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the local server.
